<p>I believe movement is life.<br> I believe you can heal your body with functional movement patterns.<br>                      I believe it is never to late to create change in a body &amp; it can happen fast.<br> I believe your
  body knows what it needs.<br> I believe every system in your body relies on a functional musculoskeletal
  system.
</p>
<p>All systems in the body work on movement:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the heart beats</li>
  <li>the lungs breath</li>
  <li>the stomach grinds</li>
  <li>the colon transports</li>
  <li>the blood flows</li>
  <li>the nerves conduct</li>
  <li>the muscles contract</li>
</ul>
<p>Dis-ease in the body begins when movement is impaired. Restore your proper design for movement and your
  pain will cease. No fancy machinery or magic pills required; your body already has everything it needs
  to heal.</p>
<p>I believe you need to trust yourself.<br> I believe you need to take responsibility for your present
  state of health.<br> I believe you can become free of your pain.</p>
